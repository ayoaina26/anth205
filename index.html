	<h4><a name="SI">Supplemental Instruction (SI)</a></h4> 

	<p /> We are fortunate to have an excellent Supplemental
	Instruction (SI) leader this semester, Mr Garrett Garvelli.  SI is
	a program run out of the Center for Teaching Excellence that
	provides an SI leader for certain courses in the university
	(typically large intro courses). An SI leader for a course is a
	student who has excelled in the course in the recent past and now
	shares their expertise by offering regular help sessions for
	current students of the course. Typically, your SI instructor will
	offer 2 or 3 regularly scheduled help sessions each week. The
	program is completely free. Its purpose is solely to help improve
	student performance. Take advantage of it!  Statistically,
	students who regularly attend SI do significantly better (up to a
	full letter grade) than their classmates who do not. The SI
	session schedule can be found on the syllabus.

        <h4>Lecture Notes</h4>

	<p /> Links to my lecture notes can be found in the <a
	href="syllabus.html#Schedule">Lecture and Exam schedule</a> on
	the syllabus. I suggest that you print out the notes for a lecture
	the morning of the lecture and then bring them to class and
	annotate them â€” the notes are only an outline of my actual
	lecture, so there will always be additional points that it will be
	important to add. Let me know if you are having any trouble
	viewing or understanding the notes. I also very much appreciate it
	when students inform me of any errors that I've overlooked.
